official website: http://www.nginxwebui.cn

#### Function description

This project can use WebUI to configure various functions of Nginx, including HTTP protocol forwarding, TCP protocol forwarding, reverse proxy, load balancing, SSL certificate automatic application, renewal, configuration, etc., and finally generate nginx.conf file and overwrite the default configuration file of Nginx to complete the final functional configuration of Nginx.

This project can manage multiple Nginx server clusters, switch to the corresponding server for Nginx configuration at any time with one key, or synchronize the configuration of one server to other servers with one key, so as to facilitate cluster management

Nginx itself has complex functions, so this project cannot cover all functions of Nginx, only common functions can be configured, and more advanced functional configurations still need to be manually written in the final generated Nginx.conf.

After deploying this project, nginx can be configured without searching on the Internet or manually applying for and configuring SSL certificates. Only adding, deleting, modifying and checking in this project can facilitate the configuration of Nginx.

#### Technical note

This project is a Web system based on springBoot. The database use SQLite, so there is no need to install any database on the server.

sqlite.db will be released into the system user folder when the project starts, so pay attention to backup.

This system applies for the certificate through Let's ENCRYPT and USES acme.sh script to automatically apply for and renew the certificate. Once the certificate is renewed, it will be renewed at 2 am every day, and only certificates exceeding 60 days will be renewed.

When adding TCP/IP forwarding configuration support, some lower versions of Nginx may need to be recompiled,You can install the stream module by adding the -with-stream parameter, but under Ubuntu 18.04, the nginx in the official software library already has the stream module, which does not need to be recompiled. If the TCP forwarding item is configured in this system, the configuration item of ngx_stream_module.so will be introduced automatically, and the configuration file of Ngnix will be optimized to the maximum.

#### jar installation instructions 
Take the Ubuntu operating system, for example.

 **Note: This project needs to run the system command under the root user, which is very easy to be exploited by hackers. Please be sure to change the password to complex password**

1.Install the Java runtime environment and Nginx

ubuntu:

```
apt install openjdk-11-jdk
apt install nginx
```

centos:

```
yum install java-11-openjdk
yum install nginx
```

2.Download the latest release of the distribution jar

```
wget -O /home/nginxWebUI/nginxWebUI.jar http://file.nginxwebui.cn/nginxWebUI-2.5.0.jar
```

With a new version, you just need to change the version in the path

3.Start program

```
nohup java -jar -Xmx64m /home/nginxWebUI/nginxWebUI.jar --server.port=8080 --project.home=/home/nginxWebUI/ > /dev/null &
```

Parameter description (both non-required)

-Xmx64m Maximum number of memory allocated

--server.port Occupied port, default starts at port 8080

--project.home Project profile directory for database files, certificate files, logs, etc. Default is /home/nginxwebui/

--spring.database.type=mysql Use other databases, not filled with native SQLite, options include mysql and postgresql

--spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://ip:port/nginxwebui Databases url

--spring.datasource.username=root  Databases user

--spring.datasource.password=pass  Databases password

Note that the command ends with an & to indicate that the project is running in the background

#### docker installation instructions 

Note that an & sign is added at the end of the command, indicating that the docker image of this project has been produced by the background operation of the project, including nginx and nginxWebUI, for integrated management and operation of Nginx.

1.Install the Docker environment

ubuntu:

```
apt install docker.io
```

centos:

```
yum install docker
```

2.Download images:

```
docker pull cym1102/nginxwebui:2.5.0
```

3.start container

```
docker run -itd -v /home/nginxWebUI:/home/nginxWebUI -e BOOT_OPTIONS="--server.port=8080" --privileged=true --net=host  cym1102/nginxwebui:2.5.0 /bin/bash
```

notice: 

1. When you start the container, use the --net=host parameter to map the native port directly, because internal Nginx may use any port, so you must map all the native ports. 

2. Container need to map path/home/nginxWebUI:/home/nginxWebUI, this path for a project all data files, including database, nginx configuration files, log, certificate, etc., and updates the mirror, this directory to ensure that project data is not lost. Please note that backup.

3. -e BOOT_OPTIONS Parameter to populate the Java startup parameter, which can be used to modify the port number

--server.port Occupied port, do not fill the default port 8080 startup

4. Logs are stored by default /home/nginxWebUI/log/nginxWebUI.log

moreover: The following configuration file is used when using docker-compose

```
version: "3.2"
services:
  nginxWebUi-server:
    image: cym1102/nginxwebui:2.5.0
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: "/home/nginxWebUI"
        target: "/home/nginxWebUI"
    environment:
      BOOT_OPTIONS: "--server.port=8080"
    privileged: true
    network_mode: "host"

```

#### Compile 

1. Compile the package with Maven

```
mvn clean package
```

2. Compile the image with Docker

```
docker build -t nginxwebui:2.5.0 .
```

#### Add boot up run

1. Edit service file

```

Remote server management. If you have multiple Nginx servers, you can deploy nginxWebUI, log in to one of them, add the IP and username and password of other servers to the remote management, and then you can manage all Nginx servers on one machine.

Provides one-click synchronization to synchronize data configuration and certificate files from one server to another

#### Interface development 

This system provides the HTTP interface call, as long as the open http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/doc.html to view page knife4j interface.

The interface call needs to add the token in the header, where the token acquisition needs to be managed by the administrator, open the user's interface call authority, and then get the token interface through the user name and password call to get the token, and then set the global token in the document management of knife4j.

Note: In the parameter description, all fields with * prefix are required.

To block knife4j display, simply add --knife4j. Production =true to the startup parameter.
